# ML-MCDM Project Objectives

## Objective 1: Current Data Index Calculation (2011-2024)
Calculate final composite index scores and rankings for 63 provinces using 28 sub-criteria (8 criteria) scores (2011-2024) with MCDM methods.

## Objective 2: Future Year Forecasting (2025)
Forecast index scores for 63 provinces using historical data (2011-2024, 14 years) with Ensemble Learning (7 models: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Bayesian Ridge, Huber, MLP, Attention) and apply multiple MCDM methods to predicted values.
